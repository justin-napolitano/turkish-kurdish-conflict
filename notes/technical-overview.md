This repo holds a structured dataset and documentation focused on the Turkish-Kurdish conflict. It’s aimed at researchers and analysts looking into the political and social dimensions of this issue.

### Key Components
- Event database manual in PDF
- Data collection guidelines for conflict events

### Getting Started

To set it up, clone the repo:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/justin-napolitano/turkish-kurdish-conflict.git
cd turkish-kurdish-conflict
```

You’ll need a PDF reader to access the manuals. Open either:
- `turkish-kurdish-conflict-event-database-manual.pdf`
- `turkish-kurdish-conflict-event-databse-manual.pdf` (may be a duplicate)

### Gotchas
Watch for duplicate manuals. I plan to clarify this in future updates along with data processing tools and expanded documentation. This will help with streamlined research.
