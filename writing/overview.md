I started the "turkish-kurdish-conflict" repository to address a gap in accessible, organized data regarding the ongoing Turkish-Kurdish conflict. This isn't just another dataset; it's a structured event database designed to help researchers and analysts get a handle on this multifaceted political and social conflict. Let me walk you through what this repo offers and where I'm thinking of taking it next.

## Why This Repository Exists

The Turkish-Kurdish conflict is complex and deeply rooted in history. Researching it effectively requires not just information, but a structured way to analyze that information. I created this repository to serve as a resource for academics, journalists, and anyone interested in understanding the dynamics of this conflict through data. 

By providing a clear framework for data collection—including detailed guidelines on how to note and categorize events—I aim to support rigorous research. My goal is to enable users to dive deep into the historical and contemporary nuances of Turkish-Kurdish relations.

## Key Design Decisions

When I sat down to create this event database, several design principles guided my approach:

- **Clarity:** I focused on making the event descriptions as straightforward as possible. Clear categorization helps users find what they need quickly.
- **Comprehensiveness:** I aimed for the dataset to include various types of events—military actions, political movements, significant negotiations, etc.
- **Accessibility:** By providing this data in a familiar PDF format, I made it easy for anyone with a basic PDF reader to access the information.

## Tech Stack

The tech stack here is simple but effective:

- **PDF Manuals:** The primary content is available as detailed PDF manuals that explain the structure and methodology of the event database.
- **Markdown for Documentation:** I used Markdown throughout the repository for clear and easy-to-read documentation.

It’s straightforward. What matters is the content, not the tech.

## Getting Started

So, how can you start using this repository? 

1. **Clone the repo**:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/justin-napolitano/turkish-kurdish-conflict.git
    cd turkish-kurdish-conflict
    ```

2. **Open the PDFs**: These documents will guide you through understanding the database's structure and how to interpret the events:
    - `turkish-kurdish-conflict-event-database-manual.pdf`
    - `turkish-kurdish-conflict-event-database-manual.pdf` (This may just be a duplicate, but could also serve a different purpose.)

## Project Structure

Here's what you can expect to find in the repository:

```
README.md
turkish-kurdish-conflict-event-database-manual.pdf
turkish-kurdish-conflict-event-database-manual.pdf
```

- **README.md:** The file you're reading now, detailing everything you need to know about the project.
- **PDF Files:** These manuals explain the methodology and data structure clearly, which is crucial for effective research.

## Future Work / Roadmap

Now that this project is up and running, what's next? I have a few ideas kicking around in my head:

- **Consolidate Duplicates:** There are duplicates in the manuals that need clarification. I'll consolidate these to avoid confusion.
- **Enhance Data Processing:** Adding data files or scripts specifically for processing and analyzing the event data would be a game-changer.
- **Metadata or Summaries:** Including metadata or summaries would help users get a quick overview before diving deeper into the details.
- **Tools for Querying or Visualizing:** I’d love to develop tools that make it easier to query or visualize this event data.
- **Expand Documentation:** I plan to enhance documentation with real-world examples and case studies to show how the data can be used effectively.

## Final Thoughts

The Turkish-Kurdish conflict is an ongoing narrative, and there's always more to learn. I look forward to improving this repository and supporting those who are seeking to understand this complex issue through data.
