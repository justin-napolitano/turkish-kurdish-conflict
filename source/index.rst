.. topic:: What is The Turkish-Kurdish Event Database ?


    `The Turkish-Kurdish Event Database` is an agnostic archive of the human rights abuses commited in Anatolia by any group or agent.
 

The documentation will present to you the first version of a paper written by Dr. Demet Mousseau and Justin Napolitano, both of the University of Central Florida.  

It was presented at the Hague in 2019 at `The Peace Economics Conference.`  

A follow up is currently in production which will migrate the data to a Graph DB that strictly adheres to the person, object, location, event (POLE) schema.  It will also implement an NLP algorithm to parse event data in real time.
