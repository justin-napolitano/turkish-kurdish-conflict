Primary Search Procedure
========================

1. Paste the following into the search bar on the Nexis Uni home page:

    * hlead(turkey) and women or rape or slavery or sexual or trafficking or child labor or child soldier or children or violence and publication(Agence France Presse - English or associated press international )

2. Select the filter results drop down menu.   

3. Select appropriate date ranges
   

Sorting Procedure
=================	

1. Begin with the oldest listed resulted.  Then proceed chronologically.  For each story, determine if the information is relevant to the data project.  If not, discard the story. 
   

2. During periods of civil conflict, defined by the start and end dates in the Uppsala Armed Conflict Database, code violent events associated with the civil conflicts.


3. Group duplicate articles together as a single event.  In the case of disputed information, cite the most common estimates, and/or the most recently cited.


4. In the case that one article covers multiple events determine if the main actor(s), target(s), and issue(s) are different, and if so, code these as distinct events.  


5. Code a new event if the actor(s), target(s), and issue(s) are different or if there is substantial time that elapses between on event and another.  If the actors, targets, and issues are the same, but there is a brief lull in activity, code it as the same event, so long as there is significant “momentum” linking the time periods.
